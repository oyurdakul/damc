# Simulation data for the publication "Flexible Ramping Product Procurement in Day-Ahead Markets"
This repository contains the generator and load data used in the simulations presented in the publication "Flexible Ramping Product Procurement
in Day-Ahead Markets" by Ogun Yurdakul, Erik Ela, and Sahin Albayrak.  

The simulation data is based on the IEEE 14-bus test system. In contrast with the original system, the load values in various hours and buses are increased  so as to increase the stress and hence the need for flexibility ramping products in the system.

The simulation data is in a .json file format compatible with the [UnitCommitment.jl](https://github.com/ANL-CEEESA/UnitCommitment.jl/) package.
